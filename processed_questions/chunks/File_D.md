## Scenario
Francisca is the new manager of the in-house software designers and programmers. She has been telling her team that before design and programming on a new product begins, a formal architecture needs to be developed. She also needs this team to understand security issues as they pertain to software design. Francisca has shown the team how to follow a systematic approach that allows them to understand different ways in which the software products they develop could be compromised by specific threat actors.

### Answers

46. A. The correct formula for cost/benefit analysis is: (ALE before implementing safeguard) – (ALE after implementing safeguard) – (annual cost of safeguard) = value of safeguard to the organization.

47. B. Each of the listed items are correct benefits of cloud computing except "Cost of computing can be increased since it is a shared delivery model." The correct statement would be that cost of computing can be decreased since it is a shared delivery model.

48. A. An architecture is a tool used to conceptually understand the structure and behavior of a complex entity through different views. An architecture provides different views of the system, based upon the needs of the stakeholders of that system.

49. B. Threat modeling is a systematic approach used to understand how different threats could be realized and how a successful compromise could take place. A threat model is a description of a set of security aspects that can help define threats and possible attacks to consider.

50. B. Many IDSs have "heuristic" capabilities, which means that the system gathers different "clues" from the network or system and calculates the probability an attack is taking place. If the probability hits a set threshold, then the alarm sounds.

51. C. External auditors have certain advantages over in-house teams, but they will almost certainly not be as knowledgeable of internal processes and technology as the folks who deal with them on a daily basis.

52. C. The noninterference model addresses this specifically by dictating that no action or state in higher levels can impact or be visible to lower levels. In this example, the staff could learn something indirectly or infer something that they do not have a right to know yet.

53. B. HTML documents and e-mails allow users to attach or embed hyperlinks in any given text. Attackers misuse hyperlinks to deceive unsuspecting users into clicking rogue links. The most common approach is known as URL hiding.

54. C. Personnel background checks are a common administrative (not technical) control. This type of audit would have nothing to do with the web applications themselves. The other three options are typical ways to verify the effectiveness of technical controls.

55. D. Statistical time-division multiplexing (STDM) analyzes statistics related to the typical workload of each input device and makes real-time decisions on how much time each device should be allocated for data transmission.

56. D. RTP provides a standardized packet format for delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTCP provides out-of-band statistics and control information to provide feedback on QoS levels of individual streaming multimedia sessions.

57. A. Edge computing complements cloud infrastructure rather than eliminating it. It is a distributed system where some computational and data storage assets are deployed close to where they are needed to reduce latency and network traffic.

58. C. A frequency analysis identifies statistically significant patterns in the ciphertext generated by a cryptosystem. For example, the number of zeroes may be significantly higher than the number of ones.

59. D. IPSec's Authentication Header (AH) provides system authentication and integrity, but not confidentiality or availability. ESP provides system authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.

60. D. The ACID test concept in databases stands for:
- Atomicity: Either the entire transaction succeeds or rolls back
- Consistency: A transaction strictly follows all applicable rules
- Isolation: Parallel transactions are isolated from each other
- Durability: Completed transactions are permanently stored
