115. What is the name of a water sprinkler system that keeps pipes empty and doesn't release water until a certain temperature is met and a "delay mechanism" is instituted?
A. Wet
B. Preaction
C. Delayed
D. Dry

116. There are different types of fire suppression systems. Which of the following answers best describes the difference between a deluge system and a preaction system?
A. A deluge system provides a delaying mechanism that allows someone to deactivate the system in case of a false alarm or if the fire can be extinguished by other means. A preaction system provides similar functionality but has wide open sprinkler heads that allow a lot of water to be dispersed quickly.
B. A preaction system provides a delaying mechanism that allows someone to deactivate the system in case of a false alarm or if the fire can be extinguished by other means. A deluge system has wide open sprinkler heads that allow a lot of water to be dispersed quickly.
C. A dry pipe system provides a delaying mechanism that allows someone to deactivate the system in case of a false alarm or if the fire can be extinguished by other means. A deluge system has wide open sprinkler heads that allow a lot of water to be dispersed quickly.
D. A preaction system provides a delaying mechanism that allows someone to deactivate the system in case of a false alarm or if the fire can be extinguished by other means. A deluge system provides similar functionality but has wide open sprinkler heads that allow a lot of water to be dispersed quickly.

117. Which of the following best describes why Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) would integrate benches, walkways, and bike paths into a site?
A. These features are designed to provide natural access control.
B. These features are designed to emphasize or extend the organization's physical sphere of influence so legitimate users feel a sense of ownership of that space.
C. These features are designed to make criminals think that those in the site are more attentive, well resourced, and possibly alert.
D. These features are designed to make criminals feel uncomfortable by providing many ways observers could potentially see them.

118. Which of the following frameworks is a two-dimensional model that uses six basic communication interrogatives intersecting with different viewpoints to give a holistic understanding of the enterprise?
A. SABSA
B. TOGAF
C. CMMI
D. Zachman

119. Not every data transmission incorporates the session layer. Which of the following best describes the functionality of the session layer?
A. End-to-end data transmission
B. Application client/server communication mechanism in a distributed environment
C. Application-to-computer physical communication
D. Provides application with the proper syntax for transmission

120. What is the purpose of the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer in the OSI model?
A. Provides a standard interface for the network layer protocol
B. Provides the framing functionality of the data link layer
C. Provides addressing of the packet during encapsulation
D. Provides the functionality of converting bits into electrical signals
