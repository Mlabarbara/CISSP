# Questions 1-15

## Scenario 1
Josh has discovered that an organized hacking ring in China has been targeting his company's research and development department. If these hackers have been able to uncover his company's research findings, this means they probably have access to his company's intellectual property. Josh thinks that an e-mail server in his company's DMZ may have been successfully compromised and a rootkit loaded.

### Questions
1. Based upon this scenario, what is most likely the biggest risk Josh's company needs to be concerned with?
A. Market share drop if the attackers are able to bring the specific product to market more quickly than Josh's company.
B. Confidentiality of e-mail messages. Attackers may post all captured e-mail messages to the Internet.
C. Impact on reputation if the customer base finds out about the attack.
D. Depth of infiltration of attackers. If attackers have compromised other systems, more confidential data could be at risk.

2. The attackers in this situation would be seen as which of the following?
A. Vulnerability
B. Threat
C. Risk
D. Threat agent

3. If Josh is correct in his assumptions, which of the following best describes the vulnerability, threat, and exposure, respectively?
A. E-mail server is hardened, an entity could exploit programming code flaw, server is compromised and leaking data.
B. E-mail server is not patched, an entity could exploit a vulnerability, server is hardened.
C. E-mail server misconfiguration, an entity could exploit misconfiguration, server is compromised and leaking data.
D. DMZ firewall misconfiguration, an entity could exploit misconfiguration, internal e-mail server is compromised.

4. Aaron is a security manager who needs to develop a solution to allow his company's mobile devices to be authenticated in a standardized and centralized manner using digital certificates. The applications these mobile clients use require a TCP connection. Which of the following is the best solution for Aaron to implement?
A. TACACS+
B. RADIUS
C. Diameter
D. Mobile IP

5. Terry is a security manager for a credit card processing company. His company uses internal DNS servers, which are placed within the LAN, and external DNS servers, which are placed in the DMZ. The company also relies on DNS servers provided by its service provider. Terry has found out that attackers have been able to manipulate several DNS server caches to point employee traffic to malicious websites. Which of the following best describes the solution this company should implement?
A. IPSec
B. PKI
C. DNSSEC
D. MAC-based security

### Answers
1. D. While they are all issues to be concerned with, risk is a combination of probability and business impact. The largest business impact out of this list and in this situation is the fact that intellectual property for product development has been lost. If a competitor can produce the product and bring it to market quickly, this can have a long-lasting financial impact on the company.

2. D. The attackers are the entities that have exploited a vulnerability; thus, they are the threat agent.

3. C. In this situation the e-mail server most likely is misconfigured or has a programming flaw that can be exploited. Either of these would be considered a vulnerability. The threat is that someone would find out about this vulnerability and exploit it. The exposure is allowing sensitive data to be accessed in an unauthorized manner.
