# Questions 136-142

### Questions

136. A risk analysis can be carried out through qualitative or quantitative means. It is important to choose the right approach to meet the organization's goals. In a quantitative analysis, which of the following items would not be assigned a numeric value?
i. Asset value
ii. Threat frequency
iii. Severity of vulnerability
iv. Impact damage
v. Safeguard costs
vi. Safeguard effectiveness
vii. Probability
A. All of them
B. None of them
C. ii
D. vii

137. Uncovering restricted information by using permissible data is referred to as __________.
A. inference
B. data mining
C. perturbation
D. cell suppression

138. Meeta recently started working at an organization with no defined security processes. One of the areas she'd like to improve is software patching. Consistent with the organizational culture, she is considering a decentralized or unmanaged model for patching. Which of the following is not one of the risks her organization would face with such a model?
A. This model typically requires users to have admin credentials, which violates the principle of least privilege.
B. It will be easier to ensure that all software products are updated, since they will be configured to do so automatically.
C. It may be difficult (or impossible) to attest to the status of every application in the organization.
D. Having each application or service independently download the patches will lead to network congestion.

139. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning approach that determines where data samples naturally clump together. It does this by calculating the distance between a new data point and the existing clusters and assigning the point to the closest cluster if, indeed, it is close to any of them. What is this approach typically used for in cybersecurity?
A. Spam filtering
B. Anomaly detection
C. Network flow analysis
D. Signature matching

140. Sam wants to test the ability of her technical security controls to stop realistic attacks. Her organization is going through significant growth, which is also increasing the complexity of the networks and systems. To ensure she stays ahead of the adversaries, Sam wants to run these tests frequently. Which approach should she use?
A. Breach and attack simulations
B. Tabletop exercises
C. Red teaming
D. Synthetic transactions

## Scenario
Ron is in charge of updating his company's business continuity and disaster recovery plans and processes. After conducting a business impact analysis, his team has told him that if the company's e-commerce payment gateway was unable to process payments for 24 hours or more, this could drastically affect the survivability of the company. The analysis indicates that after an outage, the payment gateway and payment processing should be restored within 13 hours. Ron's team needs to integrate solutions that provide redundancy, fault tolerance, and failover capability.

### Questions
[Q141-142 are part of above scenario]

141. In the scenario, what does the 24-hour time period represent and what does the 13-hour time period represent, respectively?
A. Maximum tolerable downtime, recovery time objective
B. Recovery time objective, maximum tolerable downtime
C. Maximum tolerable downtime, recovery data period
D. Recovery time objective, data recovery period

142. Which of the following best describes the type of solution Ron's team needs to implement?
A. RAID and clustering
B. Storage area networks
C. High availability
D. Grid computing and clustering

### Answers

136. B. All items listed require numeric values in quantitative risk analysis.

137. A. Inference refers to deducing restricted information from permitted data.

138. B. Decentralized patching makes it harder, not easier, to ensure comprehensive updates.

139. B. Clustering is commonly used for anomaly detection in cybersecurity.

140. A. Breach and attack simulations allow frequent automated testing of security controls.

141. A. 24 hours represents MTD (maximum survival time), while 13 hours is the RTO (recovery target).

142. C. High availability solutions provide the redundancy, fault tolerance, and failover capabilities needed.
