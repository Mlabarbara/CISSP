38. A. A recovery time objective (RTO) is the amount of time it takes to recover from a disaster, and a recovery point objective (RPO) is the amount of data, measured in time, that can be lost and be tolerable from that same event. The RPO is the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. This value represents the earliest point in time by which data must be recovered. The higher the value of data, the more funds or other resources that can be put into place to ensure a smaller amount of data is lost in the event of a disaster.

129. B. This describes a full-interruption test, where systems are actually moved to a recovery site and tested to ensure they work properly. This is the most comprehensive and realistic type of disaster recovery test.

130. B. Business continuity management (BCM) is the holistic management process that encompasses both disaster recovery planning (DRP) and business continuity planning (BCP). It provides the framework for building organizational resilience and effective response capabilities.

141. A. The 24-hour period represents the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) - the longest time the business could survive without the service. The 13-hour period represents the recovery time objective (RTO) - the target time for restoring the service.

142. C. High availability solutions are designed to provide redundancy, fault tolerance, and failover capability to ensure critical systems remain operational. This matches the requirements described in the scenario.
